BlockHire: Decentralized Recruitment and Interview Management System

## Description

BlockHire is a blockchain-powered recruitment platform designed to securely manage candidate data, verify credentials, and streamline interview processes between recruiters and applicants. The system ensures tamper-proof records, transparent selection processes, and verified professional information stored on a distributed ledger.

Candidates upload verified academic, experience, and skill data onto the blockchain. Recruiters (admins) can access a curated, immutable list of verified applicant data for interviews. Smart contracts automate verification, access permissions, interview scheduling, and performance evaluation.
